            Age: 43<br /><br />Status: Married<br /><br />Info: Marie lives in
            United States with her family. She have 2 kids, and in a raining day
            her kids were sad, because they couldn't go outside to play, and the
            didn't know what to do at their home. That's when Marie decided to
            look at the internet for activities for raining days, and that's
            when she found, weathermoment.com.<br /><br />
            She said:<br />
            "The name of the website was so interesting, that I needed to click
            it. To think there was a website that not only was worried about the
            weather, but it was also looking for ways to make the weather more
            enjoyable. There I could find a big variety of different activities
            and ideas from all over the world. Because of this site, I could and
            will, make more memorable moments with my kids and husband in any
            kind of weather."

            He said:<br />
            "I was despered, I didn't now where to start! While I was navigating
            the internet, that's when I foud weathermoment.com. There I thought
            I would find some kind of news where it would talk about a flood,
            but instead, I found a search bar, when I searched for flood, I was
            instantly bombed by loads and loads of articles about flood, shared
            from people all over the world. I never thought that a weather
            website would have such communitie! To think that there was a
            website that do more than just show todays weather. Thank you
            weathermoment! You just saved my grade! "
