    </header>
    <main>
      <h2 id="intro">The Principles are the following:</h2>

      <ul id="list">
        <li>PARC: Repetition</li>
        <li>Visual Hierarchy</li>
        <li>Fitt's Law</li>

        <a class="website" href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="blanck"
          >https://www.microsoft.com/</a
        >
        <p class="paragraph">
          Microsoft website is one of the examples that I choose, to show the
          principle of repetition.

          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          The repetion is applied throught a lot of the sections from the
          website, and they always use this pattern.<br />
          Image -> Title -> A brief summary -> And a link to the title section.

      <div id="visual-hierarchy">
        <h2 class="principle">Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3 class="company">
          Company: The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints
        </h3>
        <a
          class="website"

        >
        <p class="paragraph">
          In my point of view, the myinstitute website, applies the principle of
          Visual Hierarchy, I'll show you why.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/Screenshot_20210925-123105_Brave.jpg"
          alt="My institute ScreenShot"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          When you get into the web page, you can instantly categorise, which
          parts are the most importants.<br />
          The first thing that I see is the part named "Classes", right after I
          see "My Classes" section, and after I see the class that I'm in and in
          the end I see the part saying "Classes Offered".<br />
          <br />
          The Website shows a Visual Hierarchy, in my point of view.

      <div id="Fitts-law">
        <h2 class="principle">Fitt's Law</h2>
        <h3 class="company">Company: Carrefour</h3>
        <a
          class="website"
          href="https://www.carrefour.com.br/informatica/notebook"
          target="blanck"
          >https://www.carrefour.com.br/informatica/notebook</a

        <p class="paragraph">
          Carrefour is a Brazilian company which is a Grocers store, just like
          Walmart.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/Screenshot_20210925-123956_Brave.jpg"
          alt="Carrefour website ScreenShot"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Because Carrefour sells a big variety of products, they needed to make
          a website, which could facilitate the user experience.<br />
          But, what did they use to facilitate the user experience? That's
          right, the solution was to apply Fitt's Law as you see in the next
          image.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/Screenshot_20210925-124007_Brave.jpg"
          alt="Carrefour website ScreenShot-Filter"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          when you search for something, right at the beggining of the products
          list, there is a option called "Filtros" or "Filters".<br />
          If you select it, you will find a few options to use to filter your
          list, in this case, since I searched for a notebook, I can filter by
          the size of the storedge, I can filter by brand and also by a specific
          type of operational system.
