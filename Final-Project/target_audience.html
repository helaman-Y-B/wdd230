                <h1>Target Audience</h1>
                <p>
                    The Target Audience that we are looking for are mainly
                    adults looking to for ways to integrate their buisnees into
                    Londrina, or people who wants a good place to start a new
                    busness. <br />
                    <br />
                    In Londrina this is possible, since Londrina is a very known
                    point of commerce and also development. <br />
                    Londrina has showed to Brazil, that it is worth to work in
                    its city, and that the future of Londrina is one of the most
                    exciting things about the city.

                    <h4>Company: SuperStock</h4>
                    <p>
                        I came from a small city nearby, and there me and my
                        friend decided to open a company. We called it
                        SuperStock. <br /><br />
                        We brough some land, and built a few ware houses, and
                        then started to rent it to other companys nearby, but
                        because it was located in a small city, it rarely cold
                        cath the attention of big industries around. We were
                        desperate for recognition! <br />
                        <br />
                        One day me and my friend were looking for more possible
                        clients, and that's when we found
                        www.LittleLondonCommerce.com. <br />
                        With it we discovered a lot of new clients, and after a
                        while, we dicided to open a SuperStock in Londrina, and
                        that was litteraly one of the best decisions we ever
                        made.

                    <h3>Name: Nicole</h3>
                    <h4>Company: GraphcalLife</h4>
                    <p>
                        Before entering GraphcalLife, I was working as a free
                        lancer, seeking like crazy for clients all around
                        Paraná, the state that I was born. <br />
                        <br />
                        After years of working in the area of design graphics, I
                        decided that I should change, and find a company for me
                        to work on, that's when a friend of mine told me about
                        Londrina, and it's commerce, so I decided to do a little
                        search of the city called Londrina. <br />
                        <br />
                        That's when I found www.LittleLondonCommerce.com, and
                        there, I could find a lot of differents companys that
                        works in the same area as I'm looking for. <br />
                        That's when I found GraphcalLife, and got more knowledge
                        of the design graphics.
