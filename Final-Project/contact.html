                        Hello my name is José, and I have being working in
                        Little London Commerce for just 1 year and it's being a
                        wonderful experience! <br />
                        <br />
                        All of the members of the Little London Commerce
                        received me and treats me as if I was a member of their
                        family, I love to work with them! <br />
                        <br />
                        But that's not all, because I work in the webpage and on
                        the app, I get earlier information of a lot of different
                        busisness from Londrina, of course I don't share it with
                        anyone, instead I just share the link of the webpage!
                        <br />
                        A lot of my friends were looking for a job in their
                        area, and Little London Commerce helped them to find
                        one!

                        <br />
                        I am formed in grapchics design and i wanted to put my
                        skills in good use, so I was searching in the web a
                        place where they were needing a graphical designer, and
                        while I was navigating I depered my self in the Little
                        London Commerce, the webpage was great, but they didn't
                        have any social medias, so I took the opportunitie, and
                        came up with a plan for them... And they loved it!

                    <h3>Nicole Costal</h3>
                    <h4>Position: Client</h4>

                    <p>
                        My name is Nicole and I'm the owner of the GraphcalLife
                        busisness. <br />
                        <br />
                        I created GraphcalLife tree years ago in Canada, and I
                        believed that it was time to reach new clients from
                        outside Canada, so I reunited with all my company
                        members and started to discuus where we should expand
                        our busisness, and after a lot of search one of the
                        members showed the Little London Commerce webpage, and
                        after looking at the possibilities that Londrina could
                        bring for our company, we decided, that Londrina was the
                        place that we should start. <br />
                        <br />
                        And... We were right, today our busisness is already
                        known trought all the Paraná, and our goal today is
                        reach all the south of Brazil!
